# Alt Season Scanner üöÄ

## Project Overview

Personal cryptocurrency scanner designed to identify promising altcoins during alt season. Focus on swing trading (3-7 day holds) without the need for constant monitoring.

## Current Status: ‚úÖ v1.2.0 - Working Scanner

- [x] Define project requirements
- [x] Establish selection criteria
- [x] Build MVP scanner
- [x] CoinGecko API integration
- [x] Binance verification
- [x] Advanced momentum scoring
- [ ] Create web interface
- [ ] Test with paper trading
- [ ] Deploy for personal use

## Core Features

### 1. Daily Momentum Scanner

- Analyzes top 100 cryptocurrencies
- Filters by our specific criteria
- Provides actionable insights, not just price data

### 2. Selection Criteria

- **Price**: < $3 USD (retail psychology factor)
- **Exchange**: Must be listed on Binance
- **Market Cap**: Top 100 only
- **Momentum**: Outperforming BTC over 7 days
- **Volume**: Significant increase indicating real interest

### 3. Key Metrics Tracked

- 7-day performance vs BTC
- Volume/Market Cap ratio
- Sector rotation (DeFi, Gaming, L1s, etc.)
- BTC dominance trend
- "Ulica Score" (retail FOMO potential)

## Technical Stack

### Backend

- **Language**: Node.js (vanilla)
- **APIs**:
  - CoinGecko (general market data)

- **Database**: Local JSON/CSV initially

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Pure JavaScript (no React)
- **Styling**: Simple CSS

## Project Philosophy

1. **KISS Principle** - Keep it simple
2. **Data-driven** - No FOMO, just numbers
3. **Personal tool first** - Built for my needs
4. **Swing trading focus** - No day trading features

npm run scan

# Run with logging and results saving
npm run scan:once

# Run continuously (every 6 hours)
npm run scan:continuous

# Test individual components
npm run test:all           # Run all tests
npm run test:gecko         # Test CoinGecko API
npm run test:binance       # Test Binance API

```

## Understanding Output

### Market Conditions

- **Bitcoin Dominance** >65% = Bitcoin Season (tough for alts)
- **Bitcoin Dominance** 60-65% = BTC Favored
- **Bitcoin Dominance** 55-60% = Transitioning

npm run dominance

# Check dominance with alerts
npm run dominance:check

# Continuous monitoring (every hour)
npm run dominance:monitor

# View recent alerts
npm run dominance:alerts
```

### Market Phases
