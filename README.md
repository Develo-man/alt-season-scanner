# Alt Season Scanner ðŸš€

## Project Overview
Personal cryptocurrency scanner designed to identify promising altcoins during alt season. Focus on swing trading (3-7 day holds) without the need for constant monitoring.

## Current Status: ðŸ”¨ Planning Phase
- [x] Define project requirements
- [x] Establish selection criteria
- [ ] Build MVP scanner
- [ ] Create web interface
- [ ] Test with paper trading
- [ ] Deploy for personal use

## Core Features

### 1. Daily Momentum Scanner
- Analyzes top 100 cryptocurrencies
- Filters by our specific criteria
- Provides actionable insights, not just price data

### 2. Selection Criteria
- **Price**: < $3 USD (retail psychology factor)
- **Exchange**: Must be listed on Binance
- **Market Cap**: Top 100 only
- **Momentum**: Outperforming BTC over 7 days
- **Volume**: Significant increase indicating real interest

### 3. Key Metrics Tracked
- 7-day performance vs BTC
- Volume/Market Cap ratio
- Sector rotation (DeFi, Gaming, L1s, etc.)
- BTC dominance trend
- "Ulica Score" (retail FOMO potential)

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Node.js (vanilla)
- **APIs**: 
  - CoinGecko (general market data)
  - Binance (volume, order book)
  - Potential: Bybit (futures data)
- **Database**: Local JSON/CSV initially

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Pure JavaScript 
- **Styling**: Simple CSS
- **Hosting**: Local initially, then Vercel

## Project Philosophy
1. **KISS Principle** - Keep it simple
2. **Data-driven** - No FOMO, just numbers
3. **Personal tool first** - Built for my needs
4. **Swing trading focus** - No day trading features

## API Keys Required
- [ ] CoinGecko API (free tier)
- [ ] Binance API (read-only)
- [ ] (Optional) Bybit API

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Scanner (Week 1)

- Console output of top picks

### Phase 2: Web Interface (Week 2)
- Simple dashboard
- Daily report view
- Basic portfolio tracking

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 3+)
- Email/push alerts
